# The analysis of the expenditure behavior of G20 countries

## Introduction:

This project is about the expenditure behavior of the 10 of the G20 countries. The G20 (or Group of Twenty) is an international forum for the governments and central bank governors from 19 countries and the European Union (EU). G20 was been founded in 1999 with the aim to discuss policy pertaining to the promotion of international financial stability, it has expanded its agenda since 2008 and heads of government or heads of state, as well as finance ministers and foreign ministers, have periodically conferred at summits ever since. It seeks to address issues that go beyond the responsibilities of any one organization. (Reference: Wikipedia)
